**Abstract**

This project was designed to help people with tunnel vision. These people donâ€™t have any peripheral vision and because of that they struggle with daily tasks. Our work was focused in improve a former system that addressed this issue. The system used ultrasonic sensors and vibration motors placed on a hat. Our team redesigned the prototype, changing the sensors and decided to use a backpack. The backpack was chosen because it would be more practical and would have a better performance than a hat. After changing the sensors we optimized the code to solve a couple of problems such as the serious response delay issue that the previous group had. An energy analysis was also made and a second solar panel was added to the new prototype. The electrical consumption was analyzed and optimized, allowing a full day of operation without the need of being connected to the grid. With all the optimizations and some minor design alterations, it is hoped that this project can evolve to an industrial level and, therefore, meet with the needs of any vision impaired person.

**Reconstructing the prototype:**

1) Rebuild the circuit as in the image;

2) Upload the code into the Arduino;

3) Charge the battery (approximately 3.5 hours) and plug it into the system;

4) Turn the system on and it should be working.
