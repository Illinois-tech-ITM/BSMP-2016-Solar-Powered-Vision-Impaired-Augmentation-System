# BSMP-2016-Solar-Powered-Vision-Impaired-Augmentation-System
This repo contains code and schematics for the project to create a solar powered and battery backed vision augmentation system.

Reconstructing the prototype:
1) Rebuild the circuit as in the .fzz file;
2) Upload the code into the arduino;
3) Charge the battery (approximately 3.5 hours) and plug it into the system;
4) Turn the system on and it should be working.
